"""Build one DK College Football Classic slate end to end: pool, cash, GPP.

The NCAAF analogue of edge/dfs_run_nfl.py, and the single entry point both
scripts/dfs_lineups_ncaaf.py and the Streamlit page call, so a lineup on the
phone and a lineup on the desktop are the same lineup.

THE SLATE IS DEFINED BY DRAFTKINGS, NOT BY THE ODDS FEED
Same rule and the same reason as the NFL builder: DK's own draftables carry
`matchup`, `competitionId` and `start` for every player, and that IS the slate.
A scraped scan holds every college event the books have posted -- 70 of them on
2026-09-24 against a 12-game main slate -- and inferring the slate from that is
how the NFL builder once gave 21 of 28 teams the wrong opponent.

WHAT IS MUCH EASIER HERE THAN IN THE NFL, AND WHY
That NFL bug was expensive because a wrong opponent broke every DST projection
(its only input is the opponent's implied team total) AND silently disabled the
one hard correlation rule, which compares `team` against `opp_team`. College DK
has no DST slot at all. So:

  * no game line is needed to build a pool -- every player is projected purely
    from his own ladders;
  * a book that has not posted a total costs NOTHING rather than costing that
    game's defences;
  * the opponent is used only for the GPP bring-back, where being wrong makes
    a lineup slightly worse rather than illegal.

Game totals and spreads are still read, for display and for the board's game
environment column, and they are allowed to be missing.

THE PRICE PATH IS THE PART THAT IS DIFFERENT, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL
DraftKings posts college player props ONLY as one-sided milestone ladders.
`dfs_project.project` cannot read them -- it needs an Over/Under pair, finds
none, and returns proj=None for every player on the board. So this module
reads the FULL ladder (a client built with main_line_only=False) and runs it
through edge/dfs_ladder.py instead.

Reading this profile with main_line_only left ON is the failure mode to watch
for: it is not an error, it returns one rung per player, and one rung projects
a nonsense mean. `build_pool` counts `one_rung` players separately for exactly
that reason -- a slate where that number is large is a misconfigured client,
not a thin board.
