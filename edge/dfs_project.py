"""Prop prices -> projected DK fantasy points, for any sport.

THE ARITHMETIC, WHICH IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE
A two-sided prop is a book's own distribution for one player's stat. Devig the
pair to get a fair P(over), read the implied mean off a normal with the sport's
sigma for that stat, multiply by DK's points per unit, and add up. That is
exactly what edge/dfs.py::project_pitcher has always done for MLB; this module
is that function with the MLB constants lifted out into edge/dfs_sport.py.

THAT CLAIM IS TESTED, NOT ASSERTED. tests/test_dfs_project.py runs this engine
and project_pitcher over the same payloads and requires the projections to
match. project_pitcher is NOT replaced -- it is backtested code with real
money behind it, and the right way to introduce a generalisation is to prove
it reproduces the specific case rather than to swap it out and hope.

WHAT THE NORMAL IS AND IS NOT DOING
It converts one posted line plus its price into a mean. It is not a claim that
receiving yards are Gaussian -- they are famously not, being zero-inflated and
right-skewed. It is a monotone map from "the book thinks P(over 62.5) = 0.47"
to "so the book's mean is about 60.5", and for that job the tail shape matters
much less than the sigma. The one place the distributional assumption does
real work is a threshold bonus (P(rush yards >= 100)), which is a genuine tail
probability -- so those are the numbers to distrust first, and the reason
`bonus` is reported as its own component rather than folded into the total.

    straight in behind the existing Odds-API-shaped payload.

    `require_all` is the MLB contract: every market in `sport.required` must be
    present. NFL uses the default (any one), because its positions read
    disjoint markets -- a quarterback has passing yards and no receiving yards,
    and demanding both would project nobody.

    `position` is the player's DK position, passed through to the sport's
    imputation rule and to nothing else. It is optional because a projection
    must still be possible without a slate: every rule falls back to a
    position-blind rate, so an unknown position degrades the imputed term
    rather than dropping the player. NFL is the only sport that reads it --
    the touchdown rate per rushing yard is measurably different for a
    quarterback than for a back, and per receiving yard for a back than for a
    wide receiver or tight end. See edge/dfs_sport.py::_nfl_impute.

    EXTRACTED 2026-09-12, and the extraction is the point. `project` above
    converts prop prices into means; everything from here down converts means
    into points, and knows nothing about where they came from. Splitting them
    lets a model that produces means WITHOUT a book -- a skill model fitted on
    nflverse player-weeks, say -- be scored through the identical assembler:
    same imputation rule, same sigmas, same distribution-scored bonuses, same
    rounding.

    That matters for the props-vs-skill question specifically. If the two
    projections went through two assemblers, any difference between them could
    be the means OR the assembly, and there would be no way to tell which --
    the same confound DFS_METHODOLOGY warns about and the reason edge/odds's
    ScrapedOddsClient was made Liskov-substitutable for the paid client rather
    than merely similar. One assembler, one variable.

    `bonus_probs` is {market: P(stat >= that bonus's threshold)} supplied by the
    CALLER, overriding the fitted normal for those bonuses. It exists for
    college football, where DraftKings posts a milestone LADDER rather than a
    two-sided line and frequently prices the bonus threshold outright -- a
    "100+" rushing rung IS P(100+ rushing yards), devigged, with no
    distributional assumption at all.

    That is a strictly better number than the one computed here, and this
    module's own docstring says why: the threshold bonus is "the one place the
    distributional assumption is doing something it is not really entitled to
    do", and edge/dfs_sport.py measured the normal under-predicting P(100+) by
    1.3-1.7 percentage points because yardage is right-skewed and a normal's
    right tail is too thin. So when a real price for the event exists, it wins.
