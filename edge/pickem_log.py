"""Append-only snapshot log -- the data that unblocks PICKEM_MODEL.md 5f.

Four experiments are currently impossible because the data was never
recorded. Each row written here is a down payment on one of them:

  * CBS post-offset isolation. There are NO historical CBS lines anywhere --
    the backtest's "pool line" is a sportsbook opener used as a proxy. To
    separate CBS's own house shading from genuine post-Tuesday drift we need
    CBS's number AND a market reading from the same moment. That is the
    `post` snapshot: cbs_line_home alongside market_line_home.
  * Line-movement velocity. Needs more than two readings per game. Every
    extra snapshot between post and lock builds that series.
  * Sharp-book agreement. The historical file is single-book. `book_lines`
    stores each book's number, so cross-book disagreement becomes
    measurable after the fact.
  * Public-pick fading. CBS community percentages exist nowhere
    historically. Captured here per game, per snapshot.

WHERE THIS LIVES, and why not in data/pickem/: everything written here is
public market information (lines, totals, CBS's community percentages), so
it is COMMITTED -- it needs to accumulate across a season, survive a
Streamlit Cloud rebuild, and be diffable. Adam's own picks, standings, and
money stay in data/pickem/, which is gitignored. Do not merge the two.

Append-only on purpose: a snapshot is a claim about what the world looked
like at one instant, and rewriting history would quietly destroy exactly
the drift signal this exists to measure. `complete` is the one narrow
exception and stays inside that rule: it fills columns that were never
measured and refuses to touch ones that were.

    The alerting chain (OnFailure= -> pickem-capture-failed@.service -> this

    four commands are deliberately soft-failing `ExecStartPre=-` /

    `append` de-dupes on (season, week, snapshot, home_team) and DROPS a
    colliding row. PICKEM_WEEKLY.md promises the opposite: "capture the market
    now, fill CBS in afterwards with the same --snapshot label". Under append
    alone that second run wrote ZERO rows, so every market-only row the timers
    banked stayed CBS-less forever -- and scripts/pickem_transferability.py
    skips any game with no CBS line, so it printed "Nothing to measure yet"
    against a log that was filling up nicely. The project's only accumulating
    dataset was being silently half-discarded.

    WHY IT STILL RESPECTS APPEND-ONLY
    A snapshot is a claim about one instant, and rewriting one destroys the
    drift signal the log exists to measure. So this fills ONLY columns that are
    currently blank and NEVER overwrites a recorded measurement -- including
    `captured_at`. Two runs of the same label cannot disagree about a number,
    only complete each other. A genuinely new reading needs a new label.

    AND WHY "BLANK" IS NOT ENOUGH -- the second bug, found 2026-09-09
    The first version filled ANY blank column, which quietly reopened the hole
    from the other side. A market-only capture that found no board banks
    market_line_home="" and n_books=0; three days later the same label is
    re-run, the board is up, and the market half was merged into a row whose
    captured_at still said Tuesday. Demonstrated:

        after tuesday: captured_at 2026-09-08T17:11:20Z, market_line_home ''
        complete() changed: 1
        after friday:  captured_at 2026-09-08T17:11:20Z, market_line_home -7.0

    Nothing downstream can detect that, and `cbs_offset` consumes it directly.
    So the fillable set is now explicit (CBS_FILLABLE) rather than "whatever
    happens to be empty", and a refused market half is COUNTED and reported --
    it means a reading is genuinely missing, which is an operator action (a new
    label), not a silent nothing.

    The rewrite is atomic (tmp file + os.replace) because this is the one place
    that touches an existing row: a crash mid-write on an append-only log that
    git is the database for would be unrecoverable.

    """How far the market sat from CBS at post time: market_at_post - cbs_line.

    Sign convention chosen so that the two components of an edge simply ADD,
    which is what makes the decomposition safe to reason about:

        total_edge = market_at_lock - cbs_line
                   = (market_at_post - cbs_line) + (market_at_lock - market_at_post)
                   =        cbs_offset          +            drift

    READ THIS BEFORE USING IT -- two traps, both of which this project fell into.

    1. SIGN. An earlier version returned `cbs_line - market_at_post` and the
       docs prescribed `true_edge = (market_now - cbs_line) - cbs_bias`.
       Substituting gives `market_now + market_at_post - 2*cbs_line`, which
       DOUBLES the offset instead of removing it, and is wrong in exactly the
       case the correction exists for (CBS off the market, no drift: returns
       -2.0 where the answer is 0.0). Fixed 2026-08-23; nothing consumed it
       while it was wrong. Regression-tested in tests/test_pickem_infra.py.

    2. DO NOT SUBTRACT THIS FROM THE MODEL'S EDGE. The pool grades against
       CBS's number, so a point of offset is worth exactly as much as a point
       of drift -- both measure the same thing: how far the number you are
       scored on sits from the market's best estimate. Netting the offset out
       would DELETE real value, not isolate it. PICKEM_MODEL.md 5f originally
       framed it as noise to remove; see 5j round 3 for why that was wrong.

    What the decomposition is legitimately FOR: testing whether the two
    components are worth the same per point. Log both, and after a season
    regress the cover outcome on each separately. The null worth testing is
    `beta_offset == beta_drift`, not `beta_offset == 0`.

    Returns None until a `post` snapshot exists with both numbers.
