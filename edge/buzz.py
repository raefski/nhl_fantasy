"""Player buzz: how often public DFS content names each player before lock.

GPP ownership is set by what the field was told to play, and the field is told
by the same few dozen YouTube shows every week. Counting who those shows talk
about is a direct read on that, where edge/dfs_nfl_theory.py's field model
only sees points per dollar. This module is the sport-free matching half;
scripts/buzz_nfl.py collects transcripts and scripts/buzz_fit_nfl.py tests
whether the counts improve the ownership fit.

A mention is counted, not a recommendation. "Everyone's on Gibbs, I'm fading
him" still says Gibbs will be owned, which is the only thing ownership needs.

Matching is tuned to YouTube's automatic captions, which capitalise proper
nouns reliably but garble first names ("Jir Gibbs", "Bjon" for Bijan). So
surnames carry most of the weight, and a bare surname or first name only
counts when it is capitalised and not the first word of a sentence -- "Love
the matchup" must not credit Jordan Love.
