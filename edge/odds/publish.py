"""Publish one scan as a file the cloud app can read.

WHY THIS IS NEEDED AT ALL
Streamlit Cloud deploys from git and runs on a datacenter IP, so it can
neither scrape (DraftKings 403s it -- HANDOFF.md section 2) nor read
data/odds.db, which is deliberately gitignored: the store is an accumulating
corpus of scraped prices and this repo is public. Without a bridge the cloud
app falls back to the paid Odds API, which is the thing being removed.

So the same trick the arbitrage page already uses: the desktop scrapes, writes
a small derived JSON, and commits it; the cloud reads that file. See
scripts/arb_agent.py, which has published data/arb_snapshot.json this way for
months.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT PUBLISHED, and why that distinction matters
Published: ONE scan, the current prices, only the markets a consumer needs.
Not published: the store itself. A single scan is ephemeral and the method is
already readable in this public repo; the accumulated HISTORY is the one asset
here that cannot be re-derived, because scraping cannot reach backwards.
Committing the database would publish that permanently and irreversibly.

THE SHAPE CANNOT DRIFT
The export runs ScrapedOddsClient's own payload builder rather than a second
serialiser, so a snapshot is byte-for-byte the shape the desktop serves. A
second implementation is how the two copies of the shared core drifted the
first time (HANDOFF.md section 1).
