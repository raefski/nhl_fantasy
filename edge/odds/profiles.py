"""Collection profiles: which leagues, how deep, and how fresh is fresh enough.

WHY PROFILES EXIST
One scan cannot serve three consumers well. The arbitrage scan is wide and
shallow-ish -- ~30 leagues, ~200s, capped at `prop_events_per_league=6`
because props are the most expensive thing in it and arbitrage only needs
*some* events to pair. DFS is the opposite: one league, but EVERY game on the
slate, because a pitcher whose props were not fetched is a pitcher with no
projection and an empty roster slot. Pick'em is narrower still and needs no
props at all.

Running the wide profile and hoping it covered the slate is how DFS would
silently lose half its pool. So the depth is named per consumer, and the cost
of each profile is stated rather than discovered.

MEASURED COSTS are from the arb scan's own instrumentation (HANDOFF.md
section 2: full scan ~200s / ~20,000 quotes across ~30 leagues). The per-profile
numbers below are estimates from that baseline scaled by league count and prop
depth; `scripts/odds_collect.py` prints the real figure after every run, and
these should be corrected from that rather than trusted.
