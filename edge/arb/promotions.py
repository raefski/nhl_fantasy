"""Read a book's PUBLIC promotions and turn the profit boosts into Boost rules.

    POST https://api.draftkings.com/en/api/promotions/v2/promotions/query

No authentication. The endpoint answers a plain anonymous request -- which is
the whole reason this is possible, and worth stating because the obvious
assumption is the opposite. There are two different kinds of boost and only one
of them is here:

  * PUBLIC opt-in offers -- the carousel on the logged-out homepage. Anyone can
    read them, so they can be discovered, and that is what this module does.
  * ACCOUNT tokens -- the "Rewards" panel inside the bet slip, issued to you
    with your own countdown. Those need your session and stay hand-entered.
    Confirmed, not assumed: v2/rewards/summary and v2/rewards/details both
    answer 401 "User is unauthenticated" to an anonymous request. See
    ACCOUNT_REWARDS_ENDPOINTS.

WHAT IS PARSED, AND WHAT IS NOT
The percentage, minimum odds, sport, expiry and whether the offer is
parlay-only all come out of the terms text reliably. Maximum stake does not:
DraftKings writes "Max betting limits apply" without a number, and the actual
cap only appears on the token once it is claimed. So max_stake is left at the
caller's default and has to be corrected by hand -- it is the one term the
scanner cannot know, and it scales every profit figure linearly.

CONSERVATIVE BY CONSTRUCTION
A promotion becomes a Boost only when the percentage AND the sport are both
read confidently. Everything else degrades to "no constraint", which is the
safe direction for a filter but NOT for a promise -- so anything unparsed is
returned alongside in `unparsed` rather than dropped silently. A boost invented
from a misread term sends you at bets you cannot place, which is exactly the
failure this project keeps finding.
