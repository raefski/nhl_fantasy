# TENNIS COUNTS THREE DIFFERENT THINGS AND CALLS THEM ALL HANDICAPS AND TOTALS.
#
# The rules in RULES catch the two spelled out in full -- "Sets Handicap",
# "Games Handicap" -- and nothing else, because they require the literal word
# "handicap". Books do not oblige:
#
#     Oddschecker / Fanatics   "Handicaps"     -- bare, no unit named
#     DraftKings               "Set Spread"    -- says spread, not handicap
#
# Both fell through to the generic `spreads` rule. That did two separate kinds
# of damage, measured on a live tennis board 2026-09-07:
#
#   * IT SPLIT ONE MARKET IN HALF. FanDuel's games handicap keys
#     `spreads_games` and Fanatics' identical market keyed `spreads`, so 21
#     rungs that name the same bet at the same line sat in different groups
#     and could never pair -- against 39 two-book tennis groups on the whole
#     board.
#   * IT WOULD HAVE MERGED TWO DIFFERENT ONES. "Set Spread" landing on the
#     same `spreads` key as "Handicaps" puts a SETS handicap of -1.5 in the
#     same group as a GAMES handicap of -1.5. A set favourite at -1.5 prices
#     around 2.5-4.0 where a games favourite at -1.5 prices around 1.3-1.5,
#     so that is not a near miss, it is a manufactured arbitrage. It has not
#     fired yet only because DraftKings' tennis subcategories were never
#     fetched; enabling them without this would have set it off.
#
# THE DEFAULT IS GAMES, and that is domain fact rather than a guess: the
# standard tennis handicap is a game handicap, and a book pricing the set
# version says so in the name. So "set" is claimed first and everything left
# over is games.
