Response is `{events: [...], markets: [...], selections: [...]}` — the same
markets/selections join as the per-event endpoint, with the event list
included, so one request covers the slate.

This host refuses datacenter IPs (403). It answers normally from a residential

can ALSO block a residential IP on request volume -- see DRAFTKINGS_ACCESS.md
