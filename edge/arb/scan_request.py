"""Phone asks, desktop scrapes.

Streamlit Community Cloud is a datacenter IP and the books 403 it, so the app
that runs there can never fetch odds itself. The machine in Connecticut can.
This is the message bus between them, and it is a file in the repo:

    phone  -> GitHub contents API -> data/scan_request.json
    desktop poller sees it        -> scrapes -> data/arb_snapshot.json -> push
    phone  -> reads the new snapshot straight off GitHub (the deployed copy
              is only the fallback -- Cloud's redeploy-on-push is unreliable)

Git rather than a queue because both ends already have credentials for it and
it works through a home router with no inbound ports. The costs are real and
worth naming: a round trip is minutes, not seconds, and every scan is a commit.

Everything here is pure except the functions that name GitHub in their
docstring, so the button and the poller share one definition of "is this
request worth acting on" instead of each guessing.
