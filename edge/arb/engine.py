    Boosts are what make two-book arbitrage routinely available rather than
    rare. A -110/-110 market sums to 1.048 -- the 4.8% is the vig, and no
    amount of shopping between two books removes it. A 50% boost on one leg
    prices it at 2.364 instead of 1.909, and the same market now sums to
    0.947: a 5.6% guaranteed profit. The boost is not an edge on top of an
    arb, it is what creates the arb.

    Three constraints decide whether one is usable, and all three change the
    answer, so none of them is optional:

      * it applies to ONE bet slip, so exactly one leg of the pair
      * it has a max stake (typically $25-$50), which caps the whole position
        rather than just that leg -- the hedge is sized off it
      * it is usually restricted to a sport, and sometimes a market type

    """(event_id, market, book, point) -> (that book's own current main
    point, whether the book's OWN data confirms it), for every alternate
    rung that should not be trusted.

    Two independent ways a rung earns that:

    CONFIRMED -- DraftKings tags exactly one selection per alternate ladder
    "main": true, the rung its own app currently treats as equal to the main
    line (ladder_main_points). When that disagrees with main_points (read
    from a DIFFERENT endpoint, the base Game market) by more than max_drift,
    DraftKings' own data is contradicting itself -- not a threshold guessing
    something looks off, an actual inconsistency. Every non-main rung in
    that ladder is flagged, regardless of its own vig: once the ladder's
    center is known to be wrong, a rung that happens to look properly
    juiced from that wrong center is not evidence of anything.

    INFERRED -- for a book with no such tag, ask the ladder where IT thinks
    the true number is. `oddsmath.pickem_crossing` reads the point at which
    the book's own devigged prices cross 50/50; a ladder built around a
    number the book has since moved past still centers on that old number,
    which is the whole defect stated directly. More than max_drift from the
    book's own recorded main line and the entire ladder is flagged.

    WHY NOT VIG. This check used to compare each far rung's own overround
    against a fixed bar (`max_vig`, default 1.06), on the reasoning that a
    genuine tail rung must be priced worse the further out it sits. That
    reasoning does not survive contact with a second book. Measured on a
    live NFL board, 2026-09-07:

        book          far rungs   median vig   fraction <= 1.06
        fanduel             722       1.0591              69.9%
        draftkings         1263       1.0700               0.0%

    FanDuel holds a flat ~5.9% overround across its whole ladder and moves
    the PRICE; DraftKings widens to ~7.0%. So a fixed bar at 1.06 separates
    the two BOOKS, not fresh rungs from stale ones -- it flagged 505 sound
    FanDuel rungs and could not flag a DraftKings rung at all, which is the
    exact inversion of what it was written to do (505 flags hid 32 of 99
    opportunities behind the app's off-by-default "show stale alt lines").
    Cross-checked against DraftKings' price at the SAME rung, those 505
    agreed to a median 2.2pp of devigged probability -- ordinary cross-book
    shading, nothing like a ladder centered ten points away.

    The center test has no such book dependence, because it is measured in
    POINTS rather than in vig: on that same board every DraftKings and
    FanDuel ladder centered within 1.45 of its own main line (medians 0.24
    and 0.30), while the DraftKings NCAAF ladder this check was written for
    centers on 54.5 against a recorded main of 62.5.

    `max_vig` survives as a FALLBACK, and only where the center cannot be
    measured at all -- a ladder too flat or too short to cross 50/50, where
    there is no center to compare. It is applied RELATIVE to the book's own
    main-line overround rather than as an absolute bar, for the reason the
    table above gives: a rung priced no worse than that book's own main line
    despite sitting far from it is the anomaly, and "no worse than its own
    main" means the same thing at either book.

    Only books with a recorded main_points entry (DraftKings, FanDuel) can
    be inferred-checked at all; only DraftKings currently has the "main" tag
    for the confirmed path. Fanatics has neither -- its feed carries its own
    separate battery of ladder checks instead (see books.ingest_oddschecker).

    A bet on a whole number returns the stake when the game lands exactly on
    it. Both sides of one group share the number, so at an integer line they
    push TOGETHER: every stake comes back and the position returns nothing --
    not a loss, but not the profit an arbitrage is reported as guaranteeing
    either.

    Only over/under and home/away groups settle against a number this way
    (a three-way field or a named outright has no line to land on), and only
    an integer one can be landed on exactly.

    Spreads live on the home-margin axis with the sign flipped -- the same
    negation `find_middles` applies to report its window -- so a group point
    of -3.0 pushes on a home margin of +3.

    This is overwhelmingly a football problem, and it arrived with Fanatics:
    DraftKings and FanDuel hang their alternate ladders on half-points, while
    the Oddschecker feed Fanatics runs on carries whole numbers too. The
    numbers it puts in play -- 3, 7, 10, 14 on a spread, and every integer
    total -- are precisely the ones NFL games land on most.

    Takes primitives rather than a MarketGroup so `price_candidates` -- which
    re-prices a SNAPSHOT and has only the stored market/point/sides -- gets
    the same answer as the live scanner instead of a second reading of the
    rule that can drift from it.

    {leg index: Boost}, empty for the unboosted variant, which is always
    first so a market that arbs on its own still reports without spending a
    token on it.

    Two DIFFERENT boosts can apply simultaneously here even though a single
    Boost only ever covers one leg ("one token, one slip") -- each is its own
    token on its own book's own bet slip, so a DraftKings token on the
    DraftKings leg and a FanDuel token on the FanDuel leg are two separate
    placements, not one token doing double duty. Boosting an additional leg
    only raises that leg's price, which can only lower arb_sum further, so
    the fully-stacked variant is never worse than any single one -- it is
    computed directly rather than searched combinatorially. Two boosts both
    eligible for the SAME leg is not a real scenario (each book normally
    offers you one live token at a time) but is resolved by keeping the one
    worth more on that leg, since only one token can go on one slip.

    ONE TOKEN CANNOT COVER TWO LEGS, even when its own terms (book, market,
    side) allow either one individually -- a same-book two-sided market with
    no other book on the far side (batter unders exist on DraftKings only,
    not FanDuel) let an unrestricted "DraftKings batter props" boost qualify
    for BOTH the Over and the Under, and the stacked variant applied it to
    both, reporting a "both sides +money" arbitrage that needs the same
    single-use token redeemed on two different bet slips at once. `used`
    tracks boosts by identity as they are claimed leg by leg, in order, so a
    boost already spent on an earlier leg is not offered again to a later
    one -- the single-leg variant for that later leg is still yielded on its
