"""DraftKings 'sportscontent' endpoint — per-event markets including props.

`US-CT-SB` is the Connecticut skin and `x-pe-loc: US-CT` matches it. No
cookies. The host geo/bot-blocks datacenter IPs, so captures must come from a
browser in-state.

The ids appear TWICE — in `templateVars` and again inside the OData filter.
Rewriting only one produces a request whose filter disagrees with its template
vars, so retargeting must rewrite both together.
