"""Free NFL spreads + totals for pick'em — no Odds API credits.

Reads DraftKings and FanDuel from their own public endpoints (the same ones
edge/arb uses) and re-shapes the result into the Odds API's event dicts, so
edge.pickem_live._parse_events, the book weighting and everything downstream
stay untouched.

HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM THE PAID PATH, honestly
edge/pickem_live.py builds its consensus from ~10 books for 2 credits a call.
This gets 2 (DraftKings, FanDuel), because those are the endpoints that
answer without a key. The model's own reasoning is that averaging cancels
book-specific noise, so a 2-book mean is a weaker reading of "the market"
than a 10-book one -- most of the gain from averaging arrives by about the
third or fourth book.

Both are provided rather than one replacing the other: use `compare()` to see
how far apart they actually are on a real slate before deciding. If the gap
is small relative to the 0.5-point move the model cares about, the free path
is enough.

Fanatics can be added as a third book once its Oddschecker league id is
known; NFL is not listed there until the season opens.

The DraftKings call here shares both its client and its host
(sportsbook-nash.draftkings.com) with edge/arb, and this runs from the same
residential machine -- see DRAFTKINGS_ACCESS.md before scheduling a capture
close to a heavy arb scan, or before adding calls here.

    +5.00, both pure artifacts of a preseason line matched onto a Week 1
    matchup. Five of six STRONG picks were garbage.

    So: keep only kickoffs inside a window, and refuse to return a board with
    duplicate home teams unless the caller explicitly opts in. A team plays
    once a week; a repeat means the window is wrong.
