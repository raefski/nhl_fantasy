"""Build one DK NFL Classic slate end to end: pool, cash lineup, GPP lineup.

The NFL analogue of edge/dfs_run.py, and the single entry point both
scripts/dfs_lineups_nfl.py and the Streamlit page call. Before this existed the
CLI carried the pool-building logic inline, which meant the app could only get
the same lineups by copying it -- the exact shape that let the two copies of
the shared core drift the first time (ODDS_LAYER.md).

THE SLATE IS DEFINED BY DRAFTKINGS, NOT BY THE ODDS FEED
This is the correction that motivated the extraction, and it was a live bug
rather than a tidiness argument.

A scraped `dfs_nfl` scan holds every NFL event the books have posted, and by
Saturday of week N that is week N *and* week N+1 -- 27 events on 2026-09-12,
14 of them next week's. The old `game_lines()` walked all of them into a
`{team: line}` dict, so for any team playing in both weeks the later event
silently overwrote the earlier one. Measured on that scan: **21 of 28 slate
teams carried the wrong opponent and the wrong game total**. The Chargers read
as facing Las Vegas (a week-3 game) rather than Arizona; Miami read as a 12.5
underdog off a week-3 line against San Francisco.

Two things broke, both quietly:

  1. Every DST was projected from the WRONG game's total and spread, since
     project_dst's only input is the opponent's implied team total.
  2. The one hard correlation rule -- a defence never faces its own lineup --
     compares `team` against `opp_team`, so a wrong opponent DISABLES the check
     rather than tripping it. A lineup could roster a DST against the very
     stack it was built around, which is the -0.351 pair the optimizer exists
     to forbid.

The fix is to stop asking the odds feed a question it cannot answer. DK's own
draftables carry `matchup` ("ARI @ LAC"), `game` (competitionId) and `start`
for every player, and that IS the slate -- authoritative, unambiguous, and
already fetched. So:

  * opponent and game id come from DraftKings,
  * the odds feed supplies only `total` and `spread`, and a line is accepted
    only when its team PAIR matches a slate matchup *and* its kickoff is within
    MATCH_TOLERANCE of DK's own start time for that game.

Seven days separate two meetings of the same pair, so a six-hour tolerance
separates the weeks with room to spare while absorbing the minute-level
disagreement between DK's start time and a book's (17:00:00Z vs 17:01:00Z on
this slate). A second event matching the same game is reported, never silently
preferred.

A CONSEQUENCE WORTH STATING: A MISSING LINE NO LONGER DROPS A PLAYER
The old builder dropped any player whose team had no game line, because that
was where the opponent came from. It is not any more. An offensive player is
projected purely from his own props and now needs no game line at all, so a
book that has not posted a total costs exactly the DSTs in that game and
nothing else. That matters because the failure it replaces was invisible: on
the live 2026-09-06 slate an unaliased team code removed Puka Nacua, the
highest-projected receiver on the board, and a thin pool looks like a thin
slate.

    The single entry point for both the CLI and the Streamlit page, so the two

    log_forward_test -- see that function for why. Every caller gets this
    for free; a caller that wants a dry run (rebuilding a past slate for
    review, say) passes persist=False rather than relying on the forward-
    test log's own past-date guard to protect itself silently.

    the slate is not priced yet, {unpriced: True, ...}. A `cash` or `gpp` of
    None means no legal lineup exists under the cap -- a real answer on a thin
    board, and deliberately distinguishable from a bad one.
