"""The two NCAAF game theories, as objectives a lineup can be scored against.

Same shape as edge/dfs_nfl_theory.py, and deliberately so: a lineup is a sum of
eight correlated random variables, give every player a mean and a standard
deviation, and both theories fall out of the same two numbers.

    cash  =  mean  -  Z_CASH * sd        maximise the downside
    gpp   =  mean  +  Z_GPP  * sd        maximise the upside

Correlation raises a lineup's spread, so the cash objective spreads across
games and refuses a stack while the GPP objective seeks one, as consequences
rather than as rules.

WHAT IS THE SAME AS THE NFL ENDS THERE. Every constant below is measured on
college football (scripts/ncaaf_fit.py, cfbfastR 2024+2025, 66,499 player-games
reduced to 4,380 player-seasons with 6+ games and a 4.0+ DK average), and
FOUR of the findings contradict the NFL build rather than reproducing it. They
are the reason this file exists instead of a `sport=` parameter on the NFL one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE S-FLEX IS A SECOND QUARTERBACK, AND IT IS NOT CLOSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DK's college roster is QB / RB / RB / WR / WR / WR / FLEX (RB,WR) / S-FLEX
(QB,RB,WR). The S-FLEX is the whole game, because college quarterbacks
outscore everyone:

    position    mean DK   median   p90    p99
    QB            17.22     15.6   33.4   51.9
    RB            10.45      7.8   23.5   39.9
    WR             8.89      6.8   18.9   35.1

    of the 40 highest-scoring player-seasons in the sample: 31 QB, 7 RB, 2 WR

A quarterback is worth roughly two receivers per roster slot. The NFL
optimiser never has to ask this question and has no slot that could.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. TWO QUARTERBACKS, BUT NEVER FROM THE SAME TEAM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
R_QB_OWN_QB is -0.098. Two quarterbacks on one college roster are competing
for the same snaps -- college teams rotate, and a backup's good game is his
starter's bad one. So "play two QBs" and "play two QBs from one team" are
opposite pieces of advice, and the second one is enforced as a hard rule in
edge/dfs_opt_ncaaf.py rather than left to the objective.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. TEAM-MATE RECEIVERS HELP EACH OTHER IN COLLEGE AND HURT EACH OTHER IN THE NFL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WR <-> own WR       NFL  -0.029        NCAAF  +0.048

This is the single most consequential difference for roster construction.
edge/dfs_opt_nfl.py's docstring reasons, correctly for the NFL, that "a second
pass-catcher from the stack team is worth LESS than the first" because
team-mates share one ball, and sets stack_n=2 on that basis. In college the
sign flips: scoring is faster, games are less script-bound, and a big passing
day lifts every receiver on the field rather than dividing a fixed pie.

So a college stack COMPOUNDS where an NFL stack does not, and STACK_N defaults
to 3 here rather than 2. That is not a taste difference; it is a measured sign
change, and it is the first thing to re-check if the GPP lineups ever look
wrong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. DO NOT PAY UP AT QUARTERBACK FOR THE FLOOR -- THE NFL LOGIC INVERTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
edge/dfs_nfl_theory.py observes that an NFL quarterback's spread barely moves
with his projection (CV 0.44 at a 20-point projection against 0.59 for a tight
end) and concludes that "pay up at quarterback and punt the volatile slots" is
what maximising a floor does once the spreads are real.

College inverts it. SD_FIT below gives, at a 20-point projection:

    QB  sd 11.60   CV 0.580      <- the MOST volatile, not the least
    RB  sd 10.60   CV 0.530
    WR  sd 10.14   CV 0.507      <- the least

A college quarterback's intercept is 8.48 DK points -- even a modestly
projected one carries an enormous floor-less spread, because he runs, he
throws interceptions, and he gets pulled in a blowout. A cash lineup still
wants quarterbacks for the MEAN (finding 1), but it should not pay up for the
most expensive one expecting safety, which is exactly what the NFL habit would
do here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROVENANCE AND ITS LIMITS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SD_FIT is regressed against a LEAVE-ONE-OUT SEASON MEAN, not against a real
model projection. scripts/nfl_variance_fit.py had 9,979 stored leak-free
projections to regress against; nothing has ever projected a college slate, so
that log does not exist and cannot until this app has run for a season. A
season mean knows nothing about the opponent, so it explains less variance than
a real projection would and these spreads are, if anything, biased HIGH.
Re-fit from data/dfs_proj_log_ncaaf.csv once there is one.

OWNERSHIP is a PRIOR and the only completely unvalidated thing in this file.
Say so wherever it is used. It is the same shape MLB's fitted gammas use, with
a parameter that has never been checked against a college contest.
