"""Shared DK MLB DFS slate builder used by both the CLI (scripts/dfs_lineups.py)
and the portable Streamlit app (app.py).

`build_slate` is the single source of truth for the pipeline that used to live
inside scripts/dfs_lineups.py::main:

  * pitchers  -> Vegas-implied projection from DK sportsbook props (Odds API, PAID)
  * hitters   -> skill x opportunity x park x matchup over confirmed lineups
                 (statsapi, FREE — empty until lineups post ~3-4h pregame)
  * optimizer -> dependency-free CASH (mean) and GPP (stack + ceiling) lineups

Credit discipline is entirely delegated to the OddsAPIClient the caller passes
in. In CACHE mode the caller builds the client with dry_run=True and a huge
live_ttl, so paid prop calls are served from data/cache/ (0 credits) and any
uncached pitcher is simply skipped (DryRunBlocked caught below). DK salaries and
confirmed lineups come from FREE public endpoints, so they always refresh live —
which is exactly what you want for the freshest lineups before lock.

    CLI or the phone app produced it — a single source of truth so scripts/dfs_grade.py
    always has something to grade.

    * data/dfs_proj_log.csv: every hitter/pitcher projection for `date` (only for
      the MAIN slate — a sub-slate like Turbo/Night must not clobber it with a
      smaller player set). Re-running for the same date overwrites that date's
      rows in place; other dates are untouched.
    * data/dfs_proj_log_<date>_g<gid>.csv: the SAME projections for a sub-slate
      build, instead of just being dropped. Found live 2026-07-10 (a cash
      Night slate) and again 2026-07-17 (a Night slate the user actually
      played, GPP finish 84th percentile / cash finish 8th) -- both times a
      real forward-test opportunity was lost because sub-slate projections
      were never logged anywhere at all, only main-slate ones. dfs_calibration.py
      now scans these files too, so any played sub-slate can be graded like a
      main slate going forward (it just can't recover the two dates above).
    * data/dfs_lineups_<date>[_g<gid>].csv: the built CASH/GPP lineups, if any.

    games: DK's own declared GameCount for the resolved draft group (from
    resolve_slate's meta) -- logged per row so dfs_calibration.py can track
    slate size going forward (2026-07-11, per user request, to eventually
    test whether ownership concentration/gamma should vary with slate size --
    see DFS_METHODOLOGY.md §17). None for callers that don't have it; rows
