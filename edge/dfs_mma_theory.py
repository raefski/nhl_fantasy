"""The two DK MMA game theories, scored against a SIMULATED FIELD.

WHAT CHANGES FROM NASCAR, AND WHY
NASCAR ranks lineups on percentiles of their OWN simulated total -- the 25th
for cash, the 90th for GPP. That is a sound proxy when the thing you have to
beat does not move with your own outcome. In MMA it moves a lot. A card is
twelve coin-flips-with-bonuses and the whole field is built from the same
twenty-four fighters: when the chalk favourite gets knocked out in round one,
YOUR score drops and so does the cash line, because half the field had him
too. A percentile of your own total cannot see that; it scores the night he
loses as a bad night for you when it is a bad night for everyone.

So the objectives are what a contest actually pays on, computed on the SAME
simulated fights the field is scored on:

    cash = P(lineup beats the double-up line)
           the line in each simulated card = the field's 56th percentile
           (a DK double-up pays the top ~44%)
    gpp  = P(lineup finishes in the top 1% of the field)

This is also where GPP leverage comes from, with no hand-set penalty: a
fighter the field is heavy on cannot lift you past the field on the nights he
wins, and a fighter the field ignored does. NASCAR subtracts
`own_weight * ownership`; here the simulation prices it.

THE FIELD IS A NOISY OPTIMISER, NOT A SET OF INDEPENDENT PICKS
The first version of this module did what the other sports do -- a softmax
over each fighter's value, normalised to 600% -- and it produced boards no
field could build: 70% on a $9,800 fighter, 70% on an $8,700 one and 59% on a
$9,300 one (an average lineup over the cap), and then 70% on BOTH corners of
the main event (140% of a fight nobody pairs). Patching each constraint on
top is whack-a-mole.

The structure that cannot produce an impossible board is the one the NFL
ownership research found in Dan's Projections ("Opt Rate" x popularity):
ownership is how often a fighter appears in the lineups people actually
BUILD, and people build lineups that score well on the projection they see.
So every legal, pair-free lineup gets weight

    w(L) = exp( (public projection of L - best) / tau )

ownership is each fighter's inclusion frequency under w, and the simulated
field is drawn from w directly. The cap, the no-pairing habit and the budget
are satisfied by construction, and tau is one number for a contest export to
fit. The PUBLIC projection mixes this model's with the FPPF DraftKings prints
in its own lobby, because that is the number the field is looking at.

EVERY CONSTANT IN THE FIELD MODEL IS A PRIOR. Nothing here has been fitted to
an MMA contest; scripts/mma_calibration.py --fit-ownership is where that
happens once exports exist.
