"""DK MMA Classic optimizer: six fighters, $50,000 -- scored EXHAUSTIVELY.

A card is 20-28 fighters, so there are C(24,6) = 134,596 to C(28,6) = 376,740
six-fighter lineups before the cap removes any. That is small enough to score
every one of them against every simulated card, which the other sports here
cannot do and NASCAR (C(37,6) = 2.3M) chose not to. So there is no hill
climb, no randomised fill and no "the heuristic reached the same lineup the
exhaustive search did" caveat: the lineup returned is the argmax over the
whole legal space, to within simulation noise.

Simulation noise is handled in two stages. Every legal lineup is screened on
the first SCREEN_SIMS simulated cards; the best FINAL_K are re-scored on all
of them. P(top 1%) is a rare event and a lineup ranked on 3,000 draws of it
has a standard error of about 0.3 points of probability, which is the same
size as the gaps between the best few hundred lineups.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A RULE HERE
Both corners of one fight are ALLOWED. Every MMA strategy source says not to
roster them, and for GPP the simulation agrees on its own (one of the two is
guaranteed to lose, which caps the lineup's ceiling). But it is a result of
the objective, not a constraint: a cash lineup that holds a cheap underdog
AND his favourite opponent is guaranteed one winner, and whether that is worth
it depends on the prices. The optimizer is allowed to find out.
