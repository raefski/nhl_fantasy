    warning before building around that team.

    CAUGHT LIVE 2026-07-09: a postponed game's abstractGameState is
    misleadingly "Final" (matches a normal completed game) -- only
    detailedState actually says "Postponed". Checking abstractGameState alone
    (as the doubleheader-authoritative-game logic does) would silently miss
    this, so this function checks detailedState specifically. Allowlist, not
    denylist -- an unrecognized detailedState is a signal we haven't seen
    before and should still be surfaced, not silently treated as normal.

    This does NOT know about a DK-specific "won't count for this contest"
    designation -- that's a contest-scoring rule DK doesn't expose via any
    free API, so it can only be a manual override (see build_slate's
    exclude_teams). This catches the more common real-world cause (the game
    itself was postponed/suspended), not the DK-contest-rules case
    specifically.

    CAUGHT LIVE 2026-07-10, prompted by the user asking "is it because the
    slate is over": the plain (unhydrated) /schedule response's embedded
    team objects have NO "abbreviation" field at all -- confirmed for every
    team, every game, that date (only id/name/link). Extracting abbreviation
    straight from the schedule response (even defensively) silently returned
    "" for every team, every time -- this function had never actually worked.
    Fixed by resolving team ID -> abbreviation via the separate, reliable
    /teams endpoint (team_id_to_abbr() above, shared with team_abbrev_map()
    in dfs_run.py for exactly this reason) instead of trusting the schedule
    payload to carry it."""
