"""The two NHL game theories, and the field model.

Same shape as the NASCAR build (edge/dfs_nascar_theory.py): a lineup is scored
on a PERCENTILE of its own simulated total, because edge/nhl_sim.py samples
whole games and the lineup total is neither symmetric nor independent across
players.

    cash  =  the 25th percentile -- clear a cash line near the field median
    gpp   =  the 95th percentile, minus an optional ownership tilt

GPP_PCT IS 95, NOT NASCAR'S 90, and the reason is hockey's correlation. A goal
pays a scorer and up to two linemates at once, so a line stack's upside is a
JOINT tail: all three score in the same games or none do. At the 90th
percentile a stack and three unrelated skaters of the same means look alike;
the difference appears further out, which is where a tournament is won. The
95th is far enough out to reward correlation and not so far that it just
chases the single highest-variance player.

THE FIELD MODEL IS A PRIOR. No NHL contest export exists yet. The shape follows
what the NASCAR export taught (the field prices off what it can see in the
lobby -- salary -- as much as off value), plus the one thing every NHL DFS
guide agrees the field chases: first power-play unit skaters. Fit it with
scripts/nhl_calibration.py --fit-ownership on the first export.
