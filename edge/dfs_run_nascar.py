"""Build one DK NASCAR Classic slate end to end: board, cash lineup, GPP lineup.

The single entry point both scripts/dfs_lineups_nascar.py and
pages/6_🏁_NASCAR_DFS.py call, so a lineup on the phone and a lineup on the
desktop are the same lineup.

THE JOIN IS EXACT, WHICH NOTHING ELSE IN THIS REPO CAN SAY
DraftKings' NASCAR `playerId` IS NASCAR's own `driver_id`. Kyle Larson is 4030
in both feeds, Denny Hamlin 1361, Tyler Reddick 4065 -- verified across a full
DK board on 2026-09-24. So there is no name normalisation, no team-abbreviation
alias table, and no fuzzy matching anywhere in this module. Every other sport
here spends real effort on that problem; this one does not have it.

THE SLATE HAS TWO STATES AND THE APP HAS TO SAY WHICH ONE IT IS IN
DraftKings prices a NASCAR field days before qualifying runs. Until then
NASCAR's feed reports every entrant with starting_position = 0, and PLACE
DIFFERENTIAL DOES NOT EXIST YET -- it is start minus finish, and there is no
start. That is not a missing input to be imputed quietly; it is most of the
scoring for most of a lineup.

So:
  * BEFORE qualifying, every driver is simulated from an ESTIMATED starting
    position -- his practice rank if practice has run, otherwise his recent
    average finish -- and `provisional` is True on the result. The lineups are
    real but the place-differential half of them is a guess.
  * AFTER qualifying, starting positions are the real grid and `provisional`
    is False.

DraftKings does NOT allow late swap on NASCAR (gametype 173,
allowLateSwap=false), so there is no second look: whatever is entered at the
green flag is what runs. That makes the post-qualifying rebuild the single
most important action in the whole weekly loop, and it is why the page leads
with which state it is in.
