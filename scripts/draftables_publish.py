"""Snapshot DraftKings draftables (salaries) for every lobby slate and push them.

DK's draftables API 403s Streamlit Cloud's datacenter IPs (first seen live
2026-09-16, minutes before a 7:10 PM lock), so the cloud app reads
data/draftables_snapshot/<gid>.json instead -- see edge/dfs.py::_draftables_raw.
That fallback is only as good as the snapshot being there before the phone
asks, so this runs on a timer from this machine (deploy/draftables-publish.timer).

Salaries are frozen per draft group, so most ticks change nothing and push
nothing; a commit lands when DK posts a new slate. Groups that have left the
lobby are pruned -- the app resolves slates from the lobby, so it can never ask
for them again.

    python3 scripts/draftables_publish.py            # snapshot + prune, no git
    python3 scripts/draftables_publish.py --push     # ...and commit/push

#: DK lobby codes to publish salaries for. NOT the odds-feed sport keys --
#: college football is "CFB" here and NASCAR is "NAS"; passing "NCAAF" returns
#: every sport in the lobby, which looks like it worked and is not.
#:
#: Each sport costs one lobby call plus one draftables call per NEW or
#: still-unpriced draft group; a group DK has already priced is frozen and
#: drops to a 6-hour heartbeat. CFB and NAS are both small lobbies -- ~18 and
#: ~4 groups against the NFL's 62 -- so the two of them together add well
#: under 10% to this timer's measured ~160 requests/day. See
#: DRAFTKINGS_ACCESS.md §2 before raising it further; this poll was once the
#: largest single source of DK traffic in the repo, by 30x, because nobody
#: had counted the groups.
#: MMA added 2026-09-26: its lobby is ~3 draft groups, one card a week.
#: NHL added 2026-09-28, the eve of opening night: ~9 groups on a 5-game night.

    """Whether this group is worth spending a DraftKings request on.

    THE THROTTLE. Before 2026-09-19 this file fetched every draft group in the
    lobby on every tick: ~62 requests, 34 ticks a day, ~2,100 requests/day to
    api.draftkings.com -- while DRAFTKINGS_ACCESS.md described this poll as
    "1-2 calls per tick". Almost all of it was provably wasted, in two ways:

      * A PRICED group cannot change. DK salaries are frozen once posted, and
        that invariant is what makes the snapshot fallback exact at all
        (edge/dfs.py). Re-fetching one cannot return anything new, so it drops
        to a slow --refresh-hours heartbeat.
      * Most UNPRICED groups are never going to be priced. Roughly 45 of the 62
        are Tiers / Snake / Best Ball / season-long game types that carry no
        salary field at all, so they returned "unpriced" every 30 minutes
        forever.

    The second rule is deliberately MEASURED, not a guess at DK's game-type
    taxonomy: a group is backed off because it has actually answered without
    salaries N times in a row, doubling 30min -> 1h -> 2h -> 4h -> cap. That
    can never starve a group the app needs, because the counter resets the
    moment DK prices it, and because a gid seen for the FIRST time has zero
    misses and so is always fetched on the tick it appears -- which is the one
    case the 30-minute timer exists for. Filtering by GameTypeId instead would
    have been fewer requests and a standing risk of silently dropping a slate
    the picker offers (MLB alone lists priced groups under two game types).
