WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A SECOND COPY OF THE CODE
Two repos exist for these sports (raefski/ncaaf_fantasy, raefski/nascar_fantasy)
so each can be its own Streamlit Community Cloud app with its own URL on the
phone. The obvious way to fill them is to write the sport twice. That is the
failure this repo has already had once and documents in ODDS_LAYER.md: two
copies of a shared core drift, and in DFS the drift costs money rather than
tidiness.

So there is ONE source of truth -- this repo -- and the other two repos are
GENERATED. Everything in them is copied, nothing is authored there, and the
README this writes says so at the top so that a future edit does not get made
in the wrong place and then lost.

WHAT GETS COPIED, AND WHY IT IS THE WHOLE `edge` PACKAGE
It would be neater to copy only the modules one sport touches. It is also not
possible to keep neat: `edge/dfs.py` reaches `edge/arb/http.py` for the
DraftKings HTTP/2 shim, `edge/odds/profiles.py` reaches `edge/arb/config.py`,
and the odds collector reaches the scrapers. Tracing that closure by hand and
keeping it traced is a maintenance liability with no upside, since the package
is a few hundred KB of text. The whole thing goes.

WHAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT GET COPIED
  * `data/odds.db` -- the accumulated scrape history. It is gitignored here for
    a reason (it cannot be re-derived, and these repos may be public) and the
    cloud app reads a published snapshot instead.
  * the other sports' pages, scripts and docs.
  * `.env`, anything under `data/cache/`.

THE CLOUD APP CANNOT SCRAPE, so the snapshots it reads are copied in:
`data/odds_snapshot_<profile>.json` for prices and `data/draftables_snapshot/`
for DraftKings salaries (api.draftkings.com 403s datacenter IPs --
DRAFTKINGS_ACCESS.md §1). Both are refreshed from the desktop by
`scripts/odds_collect.py --push` and `scripts/draftables_publish.py`; this
script only carries whatever is current at the moment it runs.

## Run it locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deploy (Streamlit Community Cloud)

1. share.streamlit.io → **New app** → this repo
2. **Main file** = `app.py`
3. No secrets are required. This app never calls a paid odds API.

Streamlit Cloud runs on a datacenter IP, which DraftKings blocks
(`DRAFTKINGS_ACCESS.md`), so it cannot scrape. It reads committed snapshots
instead — `data/odds_snapshot_*.json` for prices and `data/draftables_snapshot/`
for salaries. Both are pushed from the desktop; this app is a reader.

## Tests

```bash
pytest -q
```
